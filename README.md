Testing with hello-world to learn GitHub

I used to be a Software Engineer and wrote some of the very first volume rendering applications for Oil and Gas exploration. 
I have been out of software development for quite a while, and now work on the vendor side selling servers to run containers.
But I decided I needed to learn a bit more about containers ASAP.
